# What it does #

It is a "serverless", "client-side", or "static" web app, My Secret Notes do not send your user data to any server. Either you connect your own server at runtime, or your data stays within the browser encrypted. Data is encrypted using AES-192, which is impossible to crack. It’s codebase is open source, which can be inspected. It’s made in ES6/Javascript and ReactJs.

In future releases, We will launch support per user backend via popular cloud storages. 
We will also launch Electron based Desktop apps as well as react native mobile apps. We are also planning to launch a website. 

## Why do we need one more notes app ##

Privacy is a fundamental human right. Privacy underpins human dignity and other key values such as freedom of association and freedom of speech. Today true privacy can be rare. All the data we store in cloud is accessible to respective handlers.

We have designed our app to achieve true privacy. We

* Do not store your password.
* Do encrypt your data during all time.
* There is no backdoor in our encryption.
* Our architecture is host proof. Even if a hacker steals your data, it can’t be decrypted. 
What are the limitation 
* We do not store your password and your data can’t be decrypted without one, So if you forgot your password it can’t be recovered. Period.

## Is it too paranoid? ##

Paranoia is the key to success in the security world. Most security professionals are cautious about almost everything. They go to great lengths to protect information. Our app has incorporated all the state of the art industry practices.
